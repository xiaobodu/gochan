// gochan package is a wrapper around io.ReadWriter interface
// to create channels for communication. gochan does this by
// encapsulating io.ReadWriter interface into two separate channels
// for reading and writing.
//
// Data read from the reading channel is  wrapped in the ChanData struct
// which also contains a Err field if there is any error during reading.
// Data can be feed into the writing channel as a slice of bytes directly
// without any wrapping.
//
// When done with gochan, simply close the writing channel through CloseWriteChan()
// method or by closing  the io.ReadWriter interface.
// You should note that closing the writing channel won't affect the reading channel,
// but closing the io.ReadWriter interface will causes both reading and writing channels to be closed.
// Note:
//      1. If you closed io.ReadWriter interface and the writing channel
//         still has buffered data at the point, these data will be lost.To prevent this,
//         use CloseWriteChan() method. CloseWriteChan() will block until the
//         writing channel has finished writing buffered data or encountered errors.
//         After then, you can safely close the io.ReadWriter interface.
//      2. The reading channel won't be closed since it blocks at reading the data
//         from the io.ReadWriter interface. So the cleanest way to cleanup both
//         reading and writing channels is using CloseWriteChan() method followed by
//         a Close() method of the underlying io.ReadWriter interface if any.
//
// Internally, gochan uses two goroutines for reading and writing.
// The reading goroutine will exit when io.EOF or io.ErrClosedPipe is encountered.
// The writing goroutine will exit when there is any error during the writing.
